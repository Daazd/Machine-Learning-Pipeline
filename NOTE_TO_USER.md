### Variations of algorithm and a note to user.

This algorithm was created for a specific use case, in the training of the meteorite.json training. However, this algorithm can be used to input any format of dataset, you will need to change some variables and logic. 
For instance, you can see that in the CSV version I have used class as my entry and pivot analysis, this needs to change based on your dataset. As well as in the JSON config I have preprocessed the Y table to allow for my X table to absorb a predetermined set
of data. This is especially useful for large datasets with multiple features. However, I have included suitable code for assessing large datasets as you are aware. You as the user may be well aware of this but as a note I needed to include this for clarity. 
What I am presenting to you is a structure that is easily customizable based on your needs so feel free to do what you wish when deviating from this.
