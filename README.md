- Algorithm allows for multiple acceptance of datasets from a variety of file formats.
- Uses efficient training practices including GridSearchCV to analyze more robustly.
- Leverages use of RandomForestClassifier to create a robust and efficient model.
- Provides helpful logging, system metrics, and pre and post processing of data for more efficient/robust training.
- Leveraging of Lambda Function in conjuction with Step Functions feature of AWS provides agile creation tailored to user situations.
- Levaraging of Terraform to implement the framework needed across multiple services of AWS. Allowing for customization of services and customization of Step Function processes.
